# Image and Video Processing

This repository contains my solutions to the optional MATLAB assignments of the Coursera online course [Image and Video Processing: From Mars to Hollywood with a Stop at the Hospital](https://www.coursera.org/learn/image-processing/home/info) by Guillermo Sapiro, Duke University.
The course starts by looking at how the human visual system works and then teaches us about the engineering, mathematics, and computer science that makes digital images work. We learn the basic algorithms used for adjusting images, explore JPEG and MPEG standards for encoding and compressing video images, and go on to learn about image segmentation, noise removal and filtering. Finally, we end with image processing techniques used in medicine.

Note that these assignments are not graded.
